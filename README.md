## Comment by Laura Mazoni
This is an interesting article because it reenforces the idea that you don't need a degree to persue a career in tech. Although having a Computer Science degree contributes for building a "safety net" of jobs, it is not essential for success in the tech industry. Having an idea and knowing how to execute it well is more important than spending four years in university, in most cases.
